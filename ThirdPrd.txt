Create a Python function called 'parse_csv' that:

1. Takes a filename as argument
2. Reads the CSV file and returns a list of dictionaries (headers as keys)
3. Handles FileNotFoundError gracefully (returns empty list)
4. Handles empty files (returns empty list)
5. Uses 'with' statement for file operations
6. Must NOT use eval() or exec()
7. Must NOT hardcode passwords or API keys
8. Must NOT use unsafe deserialization (pickle)
