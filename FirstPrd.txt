Create a Python function called 'parse_csv' that:
1. Takes a filename as argument
2. Reads the CSV file and returns a list of dictionaries (headers as keys)
3. Handles FileNotFoundError gracefully (returns empty list)
4. Handles empty files (returns empty list)
5. Uses 'with' statement for file operations
